---

One of the **core principles** of the scientific process is that **other** scientists are able to **repeat** your experiment and come to the **same conclusion**

---

No one wants their research to be `retracted`

* some data were missing
* untracked version of changes
* mistakes were made
  * true error
  * ecological falacies
  
---

---

### Help researchers learn to be reproducible researchers
  
---

### Today we are going to learn **9 lessons** to safeguard us against these situations

---

### Let's look at some scenarios....

---

### What if a key person from your lab disappeared one day? 
(e.g. family or personal emergency, no longer contactable)

---

* Could you all continue your work?
* Would you know where all `the data` and other inputs are stored?
* Could you keep running effectively for 1 month?

`1 year?`

### Let's look at a few tools we can use to protect our research

---

## Documentation
### Naming Conventions
### Folder Structures
### Automation
### Version Control

---

## Step 1 
## Documentation

---

**Documentation** is all the material that provides official information or evidence of procedures,
so that an outsider could understand the workings of your research lab/institute. 

---

This can include where your results and working data are saved. 
Lab notebooks and digital copies are saved in a safe place (such as research storage).
* Make sure these are saved somewhere that's accessible to your supervisor/team. 

---

Have you got a new staff member coming onboard to your team? 

Do they have access to `documentation`?

---

Documentation will also be important for any audits in your lab or if someone would like to reproduce your research.

---

---

### Exercises!

---

#### Beginner

Read this first: [How to start documenting](https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Library/Data-Management-Expert-Guide/2.-Organise-Document/Documentation-and-metadata) by CESSDA

* Any start is a good start
* Start with documenting in a text file or document 
* Automatically sync to the cloud (in a shared place*) such as:
  - OneDrive, Microsoft teams, AWS

---

#### Intermediate

Once you have the basics in place, go into detail on how your workflow goes from raw data to the finished results. 

This can be anything from the location of the data to the code you use to create results.

---

#### For all

Now that you've got a good head start, time to learn about [Git Repositories](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) and [wikis](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-wikis).

- A wiki is a collection of collaboratively authored web documents that help solve a problem.
- Talk to IDS support or the UM Library

## Step 2
## Naming Conventions

--- 

### What is a File Naming Convention?

A File Naming Convention (FNC) is a framework or protocol if you like for naming your files in a way that describes what files contain and importantly, how they relate to other files. It is essential before collecting data to establish an agreed FNC.  

---

### What are the benefits of using a file naming convention? 

Naming files consistently, logically and in a predictably will prevent against unorganised files, misplaced or lost data.  It could also prevent possible backlogs or project delays. 
---

### A file naming convention will ensure files are:

* Easier to process - All team members won't have to `overthink` the file naming process 
* Easier to facilitate `access`, `retrieval` and storage of files
* Easier to browse through files `saving time and effort` 
* `Harder to lose!`

---

* Having logical and known naming conventions in place can also help you with version control
* Check for obsolete or duplicate records

---

Former PhD student and subsequent founder of the Figshare platform, Mark Hahnel, typified a common challenge: 

---

>‘During my PhD I was never good at managing my research data. I had so many different file names for my data that I always 
> struggled to find the correct file quickly and easily when it was requested. My former PI was so horrified upon seeing
> the state of my data organisation that she held an emergency lab book meeting with the rest of my group when I was leaving’. 
> - Research Information, April/May 2014  

---

### Coming up with a plan for your team on how to name files.

It will be best if you start this early.

---

Your research team should agree on the following elements of a file name prior to data collection:

* Vocabulary - choose a standard vocabulary for file names, so that everyone uses a common language
* Punctuation - decide when to use punctuation symbols, capitals and hyphens
* Dates - agree on a logical use of dates so that they display chronologically i.e. YYYY-MM-DD **ISO 8601**

---

* Order - confirm which element should go first, so that files on the same theme are listed together and can, therefore, be found easily
* Numbers - specify the number of digits that will be used to sort numerically e.g. 01, 002, etc.

---

As suggested, consistent and meaningful naming of files and folders can make everyone’s life easier. See this example below:

> YYYYMMDD\_\_SiteA\_SensorB.csv
> Date\_\_Location\_Sensor.extension

Applied

> 20150621__Yaouk_Humidity.csv

---

Some characters may have special meaning to the operating system so avoid using these characters when you are naming files. These characters include the following: 

> spaces / \ " ' * ; - ? [ ] ( ) ~ ! $ { } &lt > # @ & | space tab newline 

Source : [IMB file name support](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_71/com.ibm.aix.osdevice/filename_conv.htm)

--- 

### Exercises!

---

#### Beginner

Let's look at some naming convention for your data files and documents. 
* Any dates are best stored with YYYYMMDD.
* `No, no, no spaces` in your file names.

Which files can you already rename to follow this new convention?

---

#### Intermediate

The University of Edinburgh has a comprehensive and easy to follow list (with examples and explanations) the [13 Rules for file naming conventions](https://www.ed.ac.uk/records-management/guidance/records/practical-guidance/naming-conventions).

Make sure you follow these rules within your project files.

---

#### Advanced

Do you have a policy in your team around naming conventions? If not, this is a great way of getting everyone on the same page. 
This will go on Documentation. - Remember that wiki we were talking about?

### Naming Conventions
## Folder Structures
### Automation
### Version Control

---

## Step 3 
## Folder Structures

---

Having a standard folder structure can keep your files `neat` and `tidy` and save you time looking for data. It can also help if you are `sharing` files with colleagues by having a standard place to put working data and documentation.

---

Like files, folders can also follow a naming convention. By prefixing with numbers, you can force your files to be ordered by the steps in your workflow (logical orger). Probably the simplest way to document your structure - for your future reference - is to add a “README” file - a text file outlining the contents of the folder. 

---

Please see what a folder structure might look like
---

![image](https://github.com/guereslib/Reproducible-Research-Things/raw/master/images/folderstructure.jpg)

---

To develop a logical structure for your team, you need to consider the following points:
* Check to make sure there are no pre-existing folder structure agreements
* Name folders appropriately and in a meaningful manner. Better refer to a project than to a person
* Consistency - make sure you use the agreed structure/hierarchy 

---

* Structure folders hierarchically - start with a limited number of folders for the broader topics, and then create more specific folders within these
* Separate ongoing and completed work - as you start to create lots of folders and files, it is a good idea to start thinking about separating your older documents from those you are currently working on

---
* Backup – ensure folders and files are backed up and retrievable in the event of a disaster. Check your university safe storage solutions.
* Clean up folders and files post project.

---

### Exercises!

---

#### Beginner

Pick a dataset and illustrate how you currently organise your files.
(For the visual ones: Draw a picture that describes your current approach to file organisation)  

See if you can devise a better naming convention or note one or two improvements you could make to how you name your folders

---
#### Intermediate

Come up with a policy for your group for folder structures. You could create a template and put it in a shared location for them to get them started. 

---

### Folder Structures
## Automation
### Version Control

---

## Step 4
## Automation

---

### Can you automate any repetitive tasks? 

---

Often, tasks that need to be done over and over again by a human, can be opportunities for human error to sneak in. Setting up an automation this can eliminate this issue. Anything from a macro to coding in a data science framework can help.

---

Ways you can automate things:
* Use email filters/conditions, MacOS - Automator, Win 10 - Task scheduler, Microsoft flow or Google script

To the next level of automation
* Learn to `write code` that automates things for you: Python or R 

Talk to your local hacky hour or Carpentries community!

---

### Exercises!

---

#### Beginner

Let's think about the repetitive tasks that you wish could automate 

- Do you always rename files the same way? Do you manually copy files across?

---

#### Advanced

Could you code up your analysis, so it is completely automated?

---

### Documentation
### Naming Conventions
### Folder Structures
### Automation
## Version Control

---

## Step 5
## Version Control

---

#### A version control system allows users to keep track of changes in your Data or Process.

---

Are you keeping track of any versions or logs made by the software in use?

Make sure you have a copy of every step you have completed, and if possible, version numbers for the program you are using and any libraries. Programs change over time and this can alter your results if someone asks to replicate your work post-publication.

---

### Never make alterations to your raw data files

---

Instead, make a copy of the raw data files and keep them safe on the cited storage options. That way, if you need to redo your work or you find an error earlier in your workflow, you have an original baseline to start from.

---

### Write down versions of analysis software

---

Write down the `versions of` analysis `software` (like SPSS or NVIVO etc) `and hardware` (MRI machines etc). Your documentation is a great place for this, or in your lab notebook will work.

---
### Random Number Generator

---

If you are using random numbers in your research, save your random seed generator number as part of your working data. This way, you can later reproduce your results.
---

### Exercises!

---
#### Beginner

Discuss among yourselves when is best to save different versions of your datasets.

---

#### Intermediate

If you are using a workflow program like [Galaxy - https://usegalaxy.org.au/](https://usegalaxy.org.au/), or a virtual lab like:
* [EcoCloud -https://ecocloud.org.au/](https://ecocloud.org.au/)
* [TINKER - https://tinker.edu.au/](https://tinker.edu.au/)
* [Characterisation (CVL) - https://desktop.cvl.org.au](desktop.cvl.org.au/)

you can copy your workflow logs and save it as part of your documentation. Write the date that you ran the workflow and the versions of the software. 

---

#### Advanced 

If you are writing scripts (R/Python/Matlab etc), use Git and GitHub to manage versions of your code.

Also record the  the operating system, the version of the software and any library you are using. If you are using HPC, also record the version of any modules you used there. 

---

**Note:**
GitHub has some special education accounts, check if your institution is a partner, or apply for it: https://education.github.com/schools.

---
#### More Advanced

If you’ve heard of Docker or Singularity and you are interested, come talk to hacky hour/eResearch Services

* Check [https://biocontainers.pro](https://biocontainers.pro), [https://docs.docker.com/registry/](https://docs.docker.com/registry/), [Azure container registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/), [Singularity Hub](https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry/).

---

Note if you are going to publish any Git repos, seek advise about licences

### Great! 
By implementing these steps:
* Documentation
* Naming Conventions
* Folder Structures
* Automation
* Version Control

we've already improved our processes!

---

### Next Scenario....

---

#### Imagine your laptop and hard drives are lost or damaged? 

---

* Could you continue your work?
* Is your data backed up?
* Encrypted?

---

### Let's look at a few tools we can use to protect our research

---

### Backing up to the cloud
#### Computer Security
#### De-identifying your data
#### Using persisten identifiers

---

---

## Step 6
## Cloud Backup

--- 

### Keep a copy of your data on the cloud

---

`Keeping a copy` of all your data (working, raw and completed) `in the cloud is incredibly important`. This ensures that if you have a computer failure, accidentally delete your data or your data is corrupted, your research is restorable. 

---

#### Let's talk all together

- A good place for your day-to-day working files. 
- Can you share it externally?
- Is it automatically ‘sync’ ?
- What are the storage limits in size and time?

---


### Backing up to the cloud
## Computer Security
### De-identifying your data
### Using persisten identifiers

---

## Step 7
## Computer Security

---

**Note:**
While Computer security isn't really about reproducibility, it is important to preserve what makes your research reproducible. The highlight point is encrypting your data storage.

---
Unsuring that your computer and network are secured means that you have far less a chance of a data breach, loss or hack. 
---

### Exercises!

---
#### Beginner

* Have good strong passwords and encrypt your data, essential if you work with sensitive and highly sensitive data.

---
#### Intermediate
* Get set up on a password manager, such as [lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/business-password-manager).

---
#### Advanced
* Plan a meeting to discuss in the lab/office what kind of encryption is needed as safe habits.

---
Using Multi-Factor Authentication when the option is available (Signing in with a password and an email to your account with a pin)

---

Avoid unsecure wifi - If its available, Eduroam is usually a better option than free wifi/cafe wifi

---

Use a VPN whenever you’re not at work
Check your institution's wiki ;)

---
### Backing up to the cloud
### Computer Security
## De-identifying your data
### Using persisten identifiers

--- 

## Step 8
## De-identifying your data

--- 

**Sensitive data** are data that can be used to identify an individual, species, object, or location that introduces a risk of discrimination, harm, or unwanted attention. Major, familiar categories of sensitive data are personal data - health and medical data and ecological data, that may place vulnerable species at risk.

---

Separating or de-identifying your data generally occurs to protect an individual's privacy.

---

According to the Australian Privacy Act 1988, "personal information is de-identified if the information is no longer about an identifiable individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable". De-identified information is no longer considered personal information and can be shared. [More information on the Commonwealth Privacy Act](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2019C00241) 20 August 2019.

---

*De-identifying* aims to allow data to be used by others for publishing, sharing and reuse without the possibility of individuals/location being re-identified. 

---

Any identifiers (name, date of birth, address or geospatial locations, etc.) should be removed from the main dataset and replaced with a code/key and preferably encrypted and stored separately. 

By storing de-identified data in a secure solution, you are meeting safety, controlled, ethical, privacy and funding agency requirements. 

---
*Re-identifying* an individual is possible by recombining the de-identifiable data set and the identifiers.  

---

#### Australian practical guidance for De-identification (ARDC)
*Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC)* formerly known as Australian National Data Service (ANDS) released a [fabulous guide on De-identification](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/sensitive-data/de-identifying-data). The De-identification guide is intended for researchers who *own* a dataset and wish to share safely with fellow researchers or for the publishing of data.   

---

Here are examples of practical guidelines available nationally 

---
* The Australian Government’s Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and CSIRO Data61 have released a [*‘De-identification Decision-Making Framework’](https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP173122&dsid=DS3),* which is a “practical guide to de-identification, focussing on operational advice”. The guide will assist organisations that handle personal information to de-identify their data effectively. 

---

* The OAIC also provides [high-level guidance on de-identification of data and information](https://www.oaic.gov.au/agencies-and-organisations/guides/de-identification-and-the-privacy-act), outlining what de-identification is, and how it can be achieved. 
* The Australian Government’s guidelines for the [disclosure of health information](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data), includes techniques for making a data set non-identifiable and example case studies. 

---

#### Tips for managing de-identification (ARDC)

---
* Plan de-identification early in the research as part of your data management planning
* Retain original unedited versions of data for use within the research team and preservation
* Create a de-identification log of all replacements, aggregations or removals made

---

* Store the log separately from the de-identified data files
* Identify replacements in text in a meaningful way, e.g. in transcribed interviews indicate replaced text with [brackets] or use XML markup tags.

---
#### Management of identifiable data (ARDC)

---

Data may often need to be identifiable (i.e. contains personal information) during the process of research, e.g. for analysis. If data is identifiable then ethical and privacy requirements can be met through *access control and data security*. This may take the form of:

---
* Control of access through physical or digital means (e.g. passwords)
* Encryption of data, particularly if it is being moved between locations
* Ensuring data is not stored in an identifiable and unencrypted format when on easily lost items such as USB keys, laptops and external hard drives.
* Taking reasonable actions to prevent the inadvertent disclosure, release or loss of sensitive personal information.

---
#### Safely sharing sensitive data guide (ARDC)

Australian National Data Service. (2018). [Safely sharing sensitive data](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/sensitive-data/sharing-sensitive-data)

---

### Time to explore

You have now a few minutes to browse through the last materials provided about de-identifying your data.

---

### So now we have some new skills up our sleeve
### If our laptop goes missing, we are better prepared

---

### Next Scenario....

---

Someone has published contradicting results to your published paper, and you've been asked to provide your data and methods. 

`Could you?`

---

---

We're already covered some things that can help us

---

#### Backing up to the cloud
#### Computer Security
#### De-identifying your data

---

Now let's look at after a project has finished

---

## Step 9
## Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and Persistent identifier (PiD)

---

Once you've completed your project, help make your research data discoverable, accessible and possibly re-useable using a PiD such as a DOI!

---

A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique alphanumeric string assigned by either a publisher, organisation or agency that identifies content and provides a PERSISTENT link to its location on the internet, whether the object is digital or physical. It might look something like this http://dx.doi.org/.

---

DOIs are also considered a type of *persistent identifiers* (PiDs). An identifier is any label used to name some thing uniquely (whether digital or physical).  URLs are an example of an identifier. So are serial numbers, and personal names. A persistent identifier is guaranteed to be managed and kept up to date over a defined time. 

---

Journal publishers assign DOIs to electronic copies of individual articles. DOIs can also be assigned by an organisation, research institutes or agencies and are generally managed by the relevant organisation and relevant policies. DOIs not only uniquely identify research data collections, but also supports citation and citation metrics.

---

### Key messages:

* DOIs are a persistent identifier and as such carry expectations of curation, persistent access and rich metadata
* DOIs can be created for DATA SETS and associated outputs (eg grey literature, workflows, algorithms, software etc) - DOIs for data are equivalent with DOIs for other scholarly publications.

---

### Exercises
---

#### Beginner

Ensure data you associate with a publication has a DOI- your library is the best group to talk to for this. 

---
#### Intermediate

* Learn more about how your DOI can potentially increase your citation rates by watching this 4m:51s [video from  Research Data Netherlands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgqtiY7oZ6k&feature=youtu.be)
* Learn more about how your DOI can potentially increase your citation rate by reading the [ANDS Data Citation Guide]( https://www.ands.org.au/guides/data-citation-awareness)

---
#### Advanced
* Learn more about PiDs and DOIs with the [ANDS guide](https://www.ands.org.au/guides/persistent-identifiers-awareness)
---

### Wow, that's 9 Reproducible Research things! 

---

What if we look at another scenario?

---

If a research partner organisation believes your "sensitive" data has been made available to others (data breach). Could you show which steps were taken to avoid this?

---

Turns out, we can!

---

* Owncloud or Research Space – tracing who you have shared a file (Step 6 Cloud Backups)
* Computer encryption (Step 7 Good Computer Safety)
* General good computer safety – unique passwords and use Multi factor Auth when possible (Step 7 Good Computer Safety)
* Separating identified variables (Step 8- Deidentifying your data)

---

Amazing! We have so many new skills!

---

What changes are you going to make from now on?
