- Produce **plots** using ```ggplot2```. </br>
- Describe properly the entire **process** to create visualisation in R. </br>
- Build complex and customized plots from **data** in a dataframe. </br>

### IMHO....
* **Functional** data visualization
	1. Wrange data
	2. Map data to visual elements
	3. Tweak scales, guides, axis, labels, theme
* Easy to **reason** about how data drives visualization
* Easy to **iterate**
* Easy to be **consistent**

Getting started with ```ggplot2```
@snapend

```r zoom-8
<DATA> %>% 
    ggplot(aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +
    <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```

Scatter plot with simple features
@snapend

```r zoom-8
interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_point()
```

Scatter plot with geom_count()
@snapend

```r zoom-8
# my first plot with x and y variables
interviews_plotting %>%
ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items, color = village)) +
geom_count()
```

Barplot adding labels and titles
@snapend

```r zoom-8
percent_wall_type %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent, fill = respondent_wall_type)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    labs(title = "Proportion of wall type by village",
         x = "Village",
         y = "Percent")

Let your code do the talking!
@snapend

```r zoom-8
# install necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
# import data inputs
interviews_plotting <- read_csv("data_output/interviews_plotting.csv")
```
