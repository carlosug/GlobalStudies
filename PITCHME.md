### IMHO....
* **Functional** data visualization
	1. Wrange data
	2. Map data to visual elements
	3. Tweak scales, guides, axis, labels, theme
* Easy to **reason** about how data drives visualization
* Easy to **iterate**
* Easy to be **consistent**

Let your code do the talking!
@snapend

```r zoom-18
# install necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
# import data inputs
interviews_plotting <- read_csv("data_output/interviews_plotting.csv")
```

@snap[south span-100 text-gray text-08]
@[1-2](You can start insalling the library)

Getting started with ```ggplot2```
@snapend

```r zoom-18
<DATA> %>%
    ggplot(aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +
    <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```

Examples of what will you achieve to make today in R!
@snapend

```r zoom-18
# my first plot with x and y variables
interviews_plotting %>%
ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
geom_point()
```
