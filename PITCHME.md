### My personal reasons
* Functional data visualization
	* Wrange data
	* Map data to visual elements
	* Tweak scales, guides, axis, labels, theme
	* Easy to reason about how data drives visualization
	* Easy to iterate
	* Easy to be consistent

Let your code do the talking!
@snapend

```r zoom-18
# install necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
# import data inputs
interviews_plotting <- read_csv("data_output/interviews_plotting.csv")
```

```r zoom-18
<DATA> %>%
    ggplot(aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +
    <GEOM_FUNCTION>()

Let your code do the talking!
@snapend

```r zoom-18
# This is the correct syntax for adding layers
interviews_plot + 
geom_point()

# This will not add the new layer and will return an error message
interviews_plot
+ geom_point()
```
