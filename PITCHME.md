## Why is it Important?

### My personal reasons
* Functional data visualization
	* Wrange data
	* Map data to visual elements
	* Tweak scales, guides, axis, labels, theme
	* Easy to reason about how data drives visualization
	* Easy to iterate
	* Easy to be consistent

Let your code do the talking!
@snapend

```r zoom-18
# install necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
# import data inputs
interviews_plotting <- read_csv("data_output/interviews_plotting.csv")
```

Getting started with ```ggplot2```
@snapend

```r zoom-18
<DATA> %>%
    ggplot(aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +
    <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```

Examples of what will you achieve to make today in R!
@snapend

```r zoom-18
interviews_plotting %>%
ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
geom_point()
```
